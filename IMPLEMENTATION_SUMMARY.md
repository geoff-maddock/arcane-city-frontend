# Your Entities Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the "Your Entities" feature which adds a new page at `/entities/your` that displays entities followed by the currently logged-in user.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: `src/components/YourEntities.tsx`
- **Based on:** `src/components/Entities.tsx`
- **Key differences:**
  - Page title: "Your Entities"
  - Description: "Entities you follow and are interested in"
  - Uses `followedOnly: true` parameter in `useEntities` hook
  - Empty state message references followed entities
  - Uses separate localStorage key: `yourEntitiesPerPage`

### 2. Updated Hook: `src/hooks/useEntities.ts`
- **Added parameter:** `followedOnly?: boolean` (default: `false`)
- **Behavior changes:**
  - When `followedOnly` is `true`:
    - Calls `/entities/following` endpoint instead of `/entities`
    - Query is only enabled when user is authenticated
    - Query key includes 'followed' or 'all' for proper cache separation
  - Imports `authService` to check authentication status

### 3. New Route: `src/router.ts`
- **Import added:** `YourEntities` component
- **New route:** `userEntitiesRoute`
  - **Path:** `/entities/your`
  - **Authentication:** Required (redirects to `/login` if not authenticated)
  - **Component:** `YourEntities`
  - **SEO metadata:**
    - Title: "Your Entities ‚Ä¢ [Site Name]"
    - Description: "Entities you follow and are interested in."
    - Open Graph tags included
  - **Redirect behavior:** After login, redirects back to `/entities/your`
- **Route tree:** Added `userEntitiesRoute` to the route tree

### 4. Navigation Update: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx`
- **Added menu item:** "Your Entities"
  - Appears as sub-item under "Entity Listings"
  - Only visible when user is authenticated
  - Uses same icon style as "Your Calendar"
  - Smaller text size (text-sm) and indented (ml-6) to show hierarchy

### 5. Tests

#### `src/__tests__/components/YourEntities.test.tsx`
New test file with the following test cases:
- Renders your entities when data is loaded
- Shows loading state
- Shows error message when loading fails
- Shows empty state when no followed entities are found
- Toggles filters visibility
- Calls useEntities with followedOnly parameter

#### `src/__tests__/components/MenuBar.test.tsx`
- **Updated existing test:** "shows username and account button when authenticated"
  - Now also checks for "Your Entities" link presence

### 6. Documentation: `MANUAL_TESTING_YOUR_ENTITIES.md`
Comprehensive manual testing guide covering:
- Authentication requirements
- Display of followed entities
- Empty state handling
- Filter functionality
- Pagination and sorting
- Navigation integration
- Responsive design
- SEO metadata
- API endpoint verification
- Error handling
- Loading states

## API Assumptions

The implementation assumes the backend provides:
- **Endpoint:** `/entities/following`
- **Parameters:** Same as `/entities` endpoint (page, limit, filters, sort, direction)
- **Response:** Same format as `/entities` endpoint (PaginatedResponse<Entity>)
- **Authentication:** Requires valid authentication token

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Your Entities" in the navigation menu (only visible when logged in)
2. If not authenticated, user is redirected to login page with return path
3. After authentication, page loads entities from `/entities/following` endpoint
4. Page displays only entities that the user follows
5. All filtering, sorting, and pagination work the same as regular entities page

### Technical Flow:
```
User navigates to /entities/your
    ‚Üì
Router checks authentication (beforeLoad)
    ‚Üì
If not authenticated ‚Üí Redirect to /login?redirect=/entities/your
    ‚Üì
If authenticated ‚Üí Render YourEntities component
    ‚Üì
YourEntities calls useEntities({ followedOnly: true, ... })
    ‚Üì
useEntities makes API call to /entities/following
    ‚Üì
Display results with same UI as regular entities page
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/YourEntities.tsx` (new)
2. `src/hooks/useEntities.ts` (modified)
3. `src/router.ts` (modified)
4. `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` (modified)
5. `src/__tests__/components/YourEntities.test.tsx` (new)
6. `src/__tests__/components/MenuBar.test.tsx` (modified)
7. `MANUAL_TESTING_YOUR_ENTITIES.md` (new)

## Testing Status

### Automated Tests
- ‚úÖ Test file created with comprehensive coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Cannot run tests due to npm registry connectivity issues
- Expected: All tests should pass when dependencies are available

### Manual Testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Cannot perform manual testing due to inability to run dev server
- üìù Comprehensive testing guide created in MANUAL_TESTING_YOUR_ENTITIES.md

### Code Quality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Cannot run linting due to dependency installation issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Cannot run type checking due to dependency installation issues
- üí° Code follows same patterns as existing components (YourCalendar, Entities)

## Known Limitations

1. **NPM Registry Issues:** During implementation, npm registry was experiencing connectivity issues (503/504 errors), preventing:
   - Dependency installation
   - Running tests
   - Running linting
   - Running builds
   - Manual testing in dev server

2. **Backend API Endpoint:** Implementation assumes `/entities/following` endpoint exists and works similarly to `/events/attending`. If the endpoint name differs, it can be easily updated in `src/hooks/useEntities.ts`.

## Next Steps for Validation

Once dependencies can be installed:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 2. Run linting
npm run lint

# 3. Run type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# 4. Run all tests
npm test -- --run

# 5. Run specific tests
npm test -- src/__tests__/components/YourEntities.test.tsx --run

# 6. Build the application
npm run build

# 7. Start dev server and manually test
npm run dev
# Then follow MANUAL_TESTING_YOUR_ENTITIES.md
```

## Integration Notes

This feature integrates seamlessly with existing functionality:
- Uses existing authentication system
- Uses existing entity filtering system
- Uses existing pagination component
- Follows established routing patterns
- Consistent with "Your Calendar" feature design
- Maintains responsive design principles
- Includes SEO metadata

## Conclusion

The "Your Entities" feature is fully implemented and ready for testing. All code changes follow established patterns in the codebase and maintain consistency with similar features. Once npm registry issues are resolved, the automated tests should pass and the feature should work as expected.
