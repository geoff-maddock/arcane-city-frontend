# CI Setup Status

✅ **GitHub Actions workflows created:**

1. **`.github/workflows/test.yml`** - Simple test workflow
   - Runs on every PR to main branch
   - Runs `npm test -- --run`
   - Runs `npm run build`

2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Comprehensive CI workflow  
   - Runs on PR and push to main/dev/develop
   - Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
   - Includes linting, type checking, testing, and coverage

3. **`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`** - PR-specific workflow
   - Advanced PR checks with automated comments
   - Coverage reporting and build size analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push these files** to your repository
2. **Create a test PR** to verify the workflows run correctly
3. **Set up branch protection rules** (optional but recommended):
   - Go to Repository Settings → Branches
   - Add protection rule for `main` branch
   - Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Select the workflows as required checks

## Expected Behavior

- Every time someone opens a PR or pushes to it, tests will automatically run
- All tests in `src/__tests__/` will be executed
- The PR cannot be merged if tests fail
- You'll see status checks directly in the PR interface
- Build and test status badges will show in your README

## Testing the Setup

After pushing these files, create a test PR with a small change to verify:
- Tests run automatically
- Status checks appear in the PR
- Any test failures prevent merging
